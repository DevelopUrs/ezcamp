# Introduction

Many children’s summer camps these days have confusing registration, a ton of paperwork, and an unorganized and frequently changing calendar. For this project, we propose a camp registration and management application that will streamline the process for both parents and camp staff. Compared to competing products, we offer the benefits of a simple user interface, live chat, and real-time notifications.


# What does the app do?

- To offer a slick application that parents and camp staffers can use to easily register for and manage camps
- To create a simple user interface that allows parents and camp staffers to quickly communicate with each other
- To create a sign-up form, login form, a user dashboard (parents’ dashboard, staff dashboard), information board about the camp, and an events calendar.

# How does the app work?

- Parents: The application provides a sleek UI for parents to be able to easily navigate and find relevant information regarding current events related to the camp, such as the schedule. They will also be able to access information related to their children, such as registration paperwork and medical files.
- Camp Staff: The application allows the staff to be able to easily communicate with the parents. They will be able to send documents, provide live updates about scheduled events, and describe themselves for the parents to recognize during drop off.
